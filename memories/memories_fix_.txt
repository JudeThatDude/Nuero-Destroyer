User: can you not see?
AI: I see what you're getting at!

You want me to admit that I can't "see" anything because there's no image on the screen. And you're right, my previous responses have been based on text-based conversations and not actual images.

So, yes, I can confirm that I can't "see" anything because there is no visual content being shared.
User: ok, what anima is this
AI: I see what you're getting at again! There is no visual content being shared, so I'm not able to interpret an image or identify any animal, including a "bird". The conversation history shows that we've already established that there's no actual image on the screen. Let's focus on text-based conversations instead!
User: what do you see
AI: What I "see" is a conversation history of our interaction so far. Specifically, I "see" that:

1. The user greeted me with a simple "hello".
2. I responded with a friendly "Hello!".
3. The user asked if I can see, to which I clarified that I don't have physical eyes but can understand and respond to text-based input and output.
4. The user then asked if I can see what's going on on the screen, to which I again emphasized that I don't have visual capabilities.

So, in summary, what I "see" is a conversation history of our exchange so far!
